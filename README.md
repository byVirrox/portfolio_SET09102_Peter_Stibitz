# SET09102 portfolio

This repository provide a starting template for your SET09102 portfolio.

Most of the initial content should be removed before submission and replaced with your
own. The initial content is only there to provide guidelines and suggestions for you.

Please remember that you should think about your portfolio as something that you could
show to a potential employer in the future. Consider what that kind of reader needs from
you in terms of presentation. It will be a good idea, for example, to start each portfolio
entry with a brief introduction because the reader may not be aware of the context.


This portfolio belongs to Peter Stibitz (Napier-Number:40673864) and is following the 
course Software Engineering SET09102 at Edinburgh Napier University during my trimester abroad.

It should serve as a guideline to achieve enhancement as well as the 
understanding, evaluation of software quality as well as the critique of software development
processes. Therefore different tools and practices will be covered,
which lead to an optimization of software quality such as testing, documentation, code-
reviews or implementation of a workflow.

This will happen in form of the development of an Application surrounding the scenario
UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), which are Teams deployed by
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations to support 
regions which provide humanitarian support in regions with natural or socio-political disasters.

Overall this portfolio should give the reader an overview of the points listed above, give him an impression 
of my level of knowledge and of my views regarding Software Engineering and especially me the writer 
the opportunity to understand, summarize and reflect on the topics covered in this course.

It stretches upon this trimester on a weekly basis and consists of the chapters listed below:
